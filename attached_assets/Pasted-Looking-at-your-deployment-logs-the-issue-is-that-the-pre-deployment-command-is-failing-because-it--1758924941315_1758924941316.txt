Looking at your deployment logs, the issue is that the pre-deployment command is failing because it can't find the drizzle.config.json file. The error shows:
/app/drizzle.config.json file does not exist
This is causing your deployment to fail before it even gets to run your application. Here are the steps to fix this:
Solution Options:
1. Add the missing drizzle.config.json file to your project
Create a drizzle.config.json file in your project root with the appropriate configuration. Here's a basic example:
json{
  "dialect": "postgresql",
  "schema": "./src/db/schema.ts",
  "out": "./drizzle",
  "dbCredentials": {
    "url": {
      "env": "DATABASE_URL"
    }
  }
}
2. Update your pre-deployment command
In your Coolify configuration (Image 1), I can see your pre-deployment command is:
bashDATABASE_URL="${DATABASE_URL}" npx drizzle-kit push --force
You have a few options:
Option A: Specify the config file path explicitly:
bashDATABASE_URL="${DATABASE_URL}" npx drizzle-kit push --force --config=./path/to/your/drizzle.config.json
Option B: Use drizzle-kit without a config file by providing all parameters inline:
bashDATABASE_URL="${DATABASE_URL}" npx drizzle-kit push --force --schema=./src/db/schema.ts --dialect=postgresql
Option C: Remove the pre-deployment command entirely if you don't need to run database migrations during deployment.
3. Check your project structure
Make sure your project includes:

The drizzle.config.json file (if using option 1)
Your database schema files
All necessary dependencies in package.json

4. Verify your DATABASE_URL environment variable
From Image 2, I can see you have a DATABASE_URL environment variable set up. Make sure it's properly configured and accessible during the build process.
The most straightforward fix would be to add the missing drizzle.config.json file to your repository and ensure it's committed to your my-feature-branch. Once that's done, redeploy and the pre-deployment command should succeed.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
